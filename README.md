# Exploding Kitten

Welcome to the Exploding Kittens Card Game, a single-player online card game where you must navigate through a deck of cards containing cats, defuse cards, shuffle cards, and the dreaded exploding kitten card. Your objective is to draw all the cards from the deck without drawing an exploding kitten card.

## How to Play

1. **Starting the Game:** Click on the "Start Game" button to begin.
2. **Drawing Cards:** Click on the deck to reveal and draw a card. Each click will reveal one card from the top of the deck.
3. **Gameplay:**
   - If you draw a cat card, it's removed from the deck.
   - If you draw an exploding kitten card, you lose the game.
   - If you draw a defuse card, it's removed from the deck and can be used to defuse an exploding kitten card drawn later.
   - If you draw a shuffle card, the deck is reshuffled, and the game restarts with a new deck of cards.
4. **Winning:** Successfully draw all the cards from the deck without drawing an exploding kitten card to win the game.
